## Welcome

I'm an economist at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas](http://dallasfed.org). My research has been in the areas of utility theory, capital theory, quantitative business cycle theory, and political economy.  Recently, I have also been doing some work in the area of asset-pricing.

At the Fed, I've done some work on the topic of inflation measurement, in particular the construction of [alternative measures of core inflation](http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm). I also write a monthly "Inflation Update" for our website. If you are interested in that sort of thing, have a look [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/inflation.cfm).

You can find a copy of my CV [here]({{"/assets/cv.pdf"}}).

Here's my [research](/research/index). [Non-economics](/nonecon/index) stuff, like some of my personal interests, is coming shortly.

Since I work for the Federal Reserve, I must convey the following disclaimer:
