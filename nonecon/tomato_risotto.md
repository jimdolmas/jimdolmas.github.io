# Tomato Risotto

This is my attempt to approximate (in a vegetarian version) a tomato risotto from Momo's, a pretty authentic Italian restaurant here in Dallas. There is also a [PDF version]({{"\assets\tomato-risotto.pdf"}}), if you'd like.

*   1 small onion, chopped fairly fine
*   1 clove garlic, minced
*   1&frac12; tablespoons unsalted butter
*   1 tablespoon vegetable oil (following a suggestion in Michael Psilakis's _How to Roast a Lamb_, I use a blend of 90/10 canola/EVOO, but corn oil would do just as well)
*   1 14-ounce can best quality Italian tomatoes (e.g., Carmelina brand), milled with all their juices
*   2 cups carnaroli (or arborio or vialone nano) rice
*   6 cups broth (good homemade or 3 cups store-bought diluted with 3 cups water)
*   &frac34; cup freshly grated parmgiano reggiano
*   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
*   Salt
*   Freshly ground black pepper
*   5 or 6 basil leaves, finely slivered
*   More grated parmigiano for serving

Bring broth to slow simmer on a burner adjacent to where you’re cooking the risotto.

Heat the oil &amp; 1&frac12; tbsp. butter in a risotto pot over medium heat.  Add chopped onion and sauté until tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic and stir, about 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add rice, stir to coat. Proceed as with any risotto:  Stirring fairly constantly, add broth, a half cup or so at a time, with enough time between additions for the broth to cook away/be absorbed by the rice—just to the point where the rice starts to stick (unless you’re using a non-stick pot).

Start testing for doneness when only a cup or two of the broth remain.

Finish it as you prefer—a little crunch deep in the center of each grain of rice or thoroughly cooked through, very thick or a bit loose, etc.

For the mantecare step, off the heat, stir in the 2 tbsp. butter, grated parmigiano and slivered basil leaves. [If you are feeding children averse to little bits of green in their food, serve the finely slivered basil leaves as a garnish for the adults.]

Test for salt—whether you need much more or less than about 1 teaspoon kosher depends on the saltiness of your cheese and your broth. Stir in a couple grindings fresh pepper.

Serve with extra parmigiano cheese, with basil if you’ve thus far left it out, and with a really crisp white wine to wash it down.
