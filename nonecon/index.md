# Non-economics stuff

## Food & drink
I love to cook.

I have a few favorite, "go-to" cookbooks. For Greek cuisine, I think nothing (not even the encyclopedic *Vefa's Kitchen!*) beats Vilma Liacouras-Chantiles' [*The Food of Greece*](*The Food of Greece*). This book is a treasure, if only for here *yiouvetsi kritharaki* and *saltsa kima*. My copy long ago began to fall apart from continual use.

Michael Psilakis' [*How to Roast a Lamb*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Roast-Lamb-Classic-Cooking/dp/0316041211) is also a great one, though the recipes are in general quite time-consuming; a beauty of this book---for me as a Greek-American---is how he weaves the recipes together with vignettes and photos of growing up in a Greek household much, it seems, like my own parents'.

I also love cooking Italian; at least as presented by [Marcella Hazan](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X), or as expressed in the variety of *ragus* in Lynne Kasper's [*The Splendid Table*](https://www.amazon.com/Splendid-Table-Emilia-Romagna-Heartland-Northern/dp/0688089631), it has a kind of logic that I haven't found in other cuisines.
